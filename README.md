A tic-tac-toe game that can be played in the console against an AI opponent. Key Concepts: Game design, AI implementation. DSA Focus: Arrays for the game board; trees for the AI decision-making using the minimax algorithm. Complexity: Intermediate. Using recursive functions and minimax theory, which is used to determine the optimal move for the AI based on a game tree.
